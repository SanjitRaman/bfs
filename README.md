## Get Started

0. Clone the repository.
1. Install the requirements:
2. (a) [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) (to import csv files that represent the graph)
3. Open and run with a python debugger (e.g. the one that comes with the [Python VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)) and run step by step!
4. Play around by drawing different graph shapes on paper and seeing how the breadth-first-search explores them!

The program is written to mirror the pseudocode as closely as possible so that the program is interactive, with the minimal number of library imports.

## Run your own graphs?
You can easily change the graph by rewriting:
adjacency_matrix.csv

and display different characters using labels_matching_adjacency_matrix.csv by giving names for each column/row of the adjacency matrix.
